This folder contains:

 - License.txt - license file;

 - FSAC1.exe - program executable. Insert the number of components in mixture, their respective names, system's temperature (constant) and composition. The program computes components' activity coefficients (gamma) in mixture. If a binary mixture is inserted, the program computes gamma profile by varying one component molar fraction from 0 to 1. Also, if component's vapour pressures are given, it computes the system's total pressure and vapour composition at equilibrium with the liquid phase;

 - lib - contains the following files:

  * FSAC1-comps.csv - contains name, the subgroups which the molecule is divided and other information; 
 
  * FSAC1-subgroups.csv - contains the group that the subgroup belongs and the subgroup's volume and superficial area;

  * FSAC1-groups.csv - contains the positive and negative areas and information about the number of hydrogen-bonding sites of each group (however hydrogen-bonds are not handled in this version, check version 2);

The following files are created during program execution (only for binary mixtures):

 - Gamma.dat - gamma profile;

 - PressureProfile.csv - pressure profile (if the vapour pressures are inserted - if not, this file is not created).

Source files:

 - Main.f90 - the main program. This can be modified or replaced in case of using this model implementation in another program; 

 - Allocation.f90 - contains subroutines that allocate all the vectors and matrices, set the variables and compute the variables that do not change during program execution;

 - Activity.f90 - contains subroutines that compute the activity coefficient according to the F-SAC model for a given composition;

 - CompsData.f90 - reads groups and subgroups data contained in lib folder files;

 - RaoultPressure.f90 - computes the system's total pressure and vapour composition at equilibrium with the liquid phase (constant temperature). It uses the modified Raoult's law.
